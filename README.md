### Hey, I'm Yann ðŸ‘‹

--- 

I'm a software engineer that loves to build cool applications and solve everyday problems with code.
I'll gladly spend two weeks automating a one minute task. Totally worth it, don't you think ?

```javascript
const yann = {
  code: [JavaScript, HTML, CSS, SQL],
  tools: [React, Redux, Jest, Node, Express, Styled-Components, Sass, MUI Materials],
  isHirable: true,
  languages: [French, English, Swedish]
  }
```
